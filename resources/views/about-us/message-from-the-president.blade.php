                <p>Welcome in the Blessed Name of Our Redeemer, Jesus Christ!</p>

                <p>I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the students currently enrolled in various programs at the
                    Kathmandu Bible Institute & Research Centre (KBI). I also express my sincere appreciation to the
                    local churches for trusting KBI and sending their students (pastors and leaders) for study. Your
                    trust and support in our institution are deeply valued!</p>
                <p>KBI is committed to serving the Lord in partnership with local churches, training, and equipping
                    individuals for God's mission in Nepal. In our country's current context, we recognize the
                    significant responsibility we have to bridge the gap between the church and society and between the
                    church and the government. Bridging these gaps allows the gospel to touch people's hearts.
                    Therefore, KBI encourages men and women from local churches to receive training in biblical,
                    theological, missiological, historical, and contextual studies to help fill these gaps and fulfil
                    the Great Commission of our Lord</p>

                <p>KBI aims to strengthen local churches academically and spiritually equip their leaders while they
                    remain actively involved in their church's ministries. These trained leaders can then actively and
                    faithfully disciple others in their churches, protect their congregations from false teachings, and
                    lay a solid foundation in the Word of God. In this way, KBI contributes to building strong local
                    churches in our country.</p>

                <p>KBI also prioritizes the development of indigenous writings and research works on Nepali Christianity
                    by current and future students of this institution. Given the current state of our country, there is
                    a significant need for developing indigenous writing, and KBI is eager to contribute to this effort.
                </p>

                <p>With a well-developed curriculum and experienced professors, KBI warmly welcomes all those who wish
                    to be academically and spiritually trained in the Word of God to fulfil the Great Commission of
                    Jesus Christ. We invite you to join our program!</p>
